## Introduction

In December 2020 the owner of cleaning service for industrial premises contacted me with an order for the development of a custom Customer Relationship Management software based on Google Sheets. Their command had tried to use modern CRMs like Bitrix, but it had been unproductive for them due to insufficient qualifications and a high entry threshold for the user.

We made a decision to develop software to realize several related sheets, which would exchange data using Google Apps Scripts. After the two weeks of development, we had a beta of an application. During the month of testing by me and the customer's team, we had end-product which the customer implements to the business successfully. The product performs the functions assigned at the time of the writing this intro. It's one of the reasons that I decided to publicate the source code for my readers.

## Development the documentation

Now I'm working on the documentantion and the test version of this application. I have the following reasons for that:

- There are not so much applications in open source with Google Scripts for Google Sheets. In fact, I have find no one project this level in free access. In my opinion, this is due to the specificity of the technical task.

- That's not a library. I want to demonstrate how we can develop not one step scripts on this platform, using OOP and combining the logic of working with separate data.

- If you like some of the coding patters that you see in this project and will use them in your practice, then I write this for a reason.

- If the customer wants to continue develop the product with other developers, they will be able to understand my code and find better solution for the task at hand. Unfortunately, I don't always have enough time to support existing projects.

- Unfortunately, the application has a poor git history. That's why it was developed only by me in a short time, in which I was engaged in the other projects too. I try to compensate for it with the documentation.

## Ethics

I don't publicate any personal or confidential data of the customer or them business. They interest only final result. They are looking at the application as a business tool, not a commercial product for distribution. This is the reason it is ethical to make the source code public.
